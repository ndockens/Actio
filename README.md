<p>This project was really cool!  My first taste of building microservices using .NET Core.  I created this project during the second part of the "Modern Web Development with ASP.NET Core" course (https://www.udemy.com/course/learning-path-modern-web-development-with-aspnet-core).</p>

<p>.NET Core, microservice architecture, containerization using Docker, API integration testing... The variety of things I got to play around with here was awesome.  I even started building a frontend using Blazor.  Overall, this was an excellent learning project.</p>
